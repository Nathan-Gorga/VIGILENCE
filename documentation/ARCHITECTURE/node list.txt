nodes are a linked list that point to events in the event ring buffer to allow for easier referencing

they point using indexes start and stop (inclusive)

the protocol for adding an event to the ring buffer is as follows

add the linear buffer to the event ring buffer, 

keep the start and stop indexes

create a node

put the start and stop indexes in the node

push the node in the linked list

to get an event from the event ring buffer: 

we take the head of the linked list, (the head never changes and must never change as it is shared between threads, also we need a mutex around it to prevent race conditions)

we take the next node from the head node,

extract the event from the ring buffer using the start and stop indexes, 

pop the node
