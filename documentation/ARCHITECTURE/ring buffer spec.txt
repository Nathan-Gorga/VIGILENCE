obviously, they have a buffer of float in our case of predefined size

now lets see how the internal ring buffer operates : 

add continuously to it bits of data

we need to know where to write also so we need an index

for the internal ring buffer, we only need to get the full buffer back when we signal a possible shift from baseline

now for the event ring buffer 

we add data in chunks via the data intake function

we need a head index to know where to write to the buffer


we only read (copy) data using the nodes that point to the buffer so we donâ€™t really need to check for overwrite or what

therefore, the structure for a ring buffer should be 

{
buffer
bufferSize,
writeIndex
}

the other behaviour will be handled by relevant functions
