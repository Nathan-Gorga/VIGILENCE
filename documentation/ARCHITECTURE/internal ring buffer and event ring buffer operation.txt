data intake receive data from data source (it is coming in byte per byte, allow for the size to change depending on the communication protocol)

have the ring buffer big enough to contain at least two possible events 

when we detect a shift from baseline, we mark the index minus a few milliseconds, continue taking in data in the internal ring buffer
once a full revolution has been completed of the internal ring buffer, and if we have marked a potential shift from baseline, we analyse the entire buffer

here are the possible outcomes of such an activity

false positive, we only consider an event is an event if it has a minimum length, therefore we ignore the empty buffer and keep going

there is one event  in the ring buffer, we mark the start and end of the event, add it to the event buffer and create a node that points to it, adding it to the list

there is more than one event in the ring buffer, we separate them one by one and add them just as before to the event ring buffer

what if there is an overwrite in the ring buffer of an event

not possible, the ring buffer will be long enough as to contain multiple possible events

once we detect a possible shift from baseline, we save the index a few places back, do a full turn while recording the data and analyse the full buffer

note : the ring buffer cannot be TOO big as it would take too much time to analyse its entirety after a possible shift from baseline, therefore 2 seconds or even 1 seconds of data may be just what is needed for optimal recording
