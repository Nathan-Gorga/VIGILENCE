== CODING RULES ==


RULE 1
before writing any real code :

    pseudocode the function, 

    write the asserts, 

    see how it is going to interact in its lifetime of development

    document the function


RULE 2 
simple scales, fancy fails

RULE 3
one C file, one header file

avoid as much as possible to sharing header files, except the globaldefinition.header
